### What is personal fitness training ?

Personal Training can be so many different things depending on the client - that's what makes it personal! You can choose to workout with your trainer as often as five times per week but most clients opt for one to three training sessions per week for maximum effectiveness. At the very least, you should visit your trainer once every six to eight weeks to make a few changes to your program to make sure you're always progressing and experiencing results. Too many people stay on the same program for an extended period of time and wonder why they're no longer experiencing changes in their fitness level. Programming updates are very important to ensure ongoing progress. You can also choose to train for 30 minute or 60 minute sessions depending on your time. You also have the option to train alone, with a partner or in a small group setting. We make every attempt possible to customize a plan that is going to work within your schedule and budget and that will ensure success.

Personal Training has become a very popular service with many people experiencing results, therefore, demonstrating its value. When you sign up with a trainer, you can expect regular education, support and guidance. Your trainer will hold you accountable - it's nice to know you always have someone looking over your shoulder. Your trainer will provide safety, variety and efficiency and effectiveness.

### Is personal training for you?

Did you know... that IDEA, the International Health and Fitness Assocation, released a statistic that found 75% of people who exercise are not getting the results they want? But out of the 25% of people who are getting results, 90% of them are working with a Personal Trainer. Personal Training gets results and that's why anyone can benefit from this personal attention! Personal Training is no longer reserved for Hollywood stars and the "rich and famous"! Answer these questions to determine if you would benefit from working with a Personal Trainer.

### Are you just getting started with your fitness goals?

The thought of entering an exercise facility and starting an exercise program without any assistance can be intimidating. Trying to teach yourself how to use all the equipment can be so confusing. Your trainer will teach you how to exercise correctly and safely. Your trainer will provide you with enough guidance, motivation and education to ensure you establish healthy and effective exercise patterns right from the beginning.

### Not getting results?

It's common to feel like the amount of effort you're putting in is not matching the reward. Your personal trainer will change your program and show you how to get results more effectively and in less time. Your trainer will provide you with a brand new exercise regime that will take you to a higher level of fitness and health. Your personal trainer will make the difference between a great workout and a "ho-hum one" - or even no workout at all!

### Having difficulty sticking to your program?

You're not alone. Eighty percent of people discontinue their exercise program after 2-3 months. But this time, things are going to be different. Your Personal Trainer will help you adhere to your program consistently. When you schedule an appointment with a trainer, you make a commitment to yourself - a commitment that your trainer won't let you break!

### Are you an athlete or a weekend warrior?

Many people dream of the challenge of completing an athletic event. With your own personal coach, that dream becomes a reality. Whether you are training for a 5 or 10 km fun run, a half or full marathon, a triathlon, skiing, a grueling hike or just training to improve your golf or tennis game, your trainer will provide you with a plan for success.

### Suffering from an injury?

An injury can really set you back. You have the choice of doing nothing or taking an active role in feeling better. Your trainer will work with you and your health care professional to develop a safe rehabilitation program. Your trainer will assist you on your road to recovery.

### How to Work

There are many ways we can work together to help you achieve your goals. Your options include Personal Training only, participating in our small Group Training classes or a combination of both.

For example, some of our clients train privately with a trainer two to four times per week for half hour or hour sessions. Some of our clients get started with a trainer who designs a program for them and then they follow that on their own and/or take classes and just see their trainer once every one to two months to monitor progress and make updates to their program.

Then there are some clients who do a combination of both - they might see a trainer once per week to ensure a tough workout and to hold them accountable weekly and then the rest of the time they workout on their own.

So we will customize a plan to help you achieve results and will be based on your goals, interests, current fitness level, time and financial budget.
